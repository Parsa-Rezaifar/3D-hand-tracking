# 3D-hand-tracking
In this project , i created a 3D hand tracking using python , opencv and unity 

This program will detect one of your hands , using python and opencv and its libraries like cvzone , numpy ... ; then we send this detection as an data as UDP server to unity
project and there with litte of c# , we track the movement of detectde hand and simulate this detection as a 3D model

The 3D environment in unity is interactive and you can move to any directions and deal with cubes

You can simulate any shapes of your hand like : hand gesturs , showing hand signs , showing numbers and a lot more
